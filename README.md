# GraphIndor

GraphIndor is being refactored.

The cpu codes and gpu codes are in `cpu/` and `gpu/`, respectively.

The sample graphs are in `dataset`. `*.adj` is the labeled graph for Frequent Subgraph Mining.  `*.g` is the binary unlabeled graph for other applications.

Other information, such as how to run different applications and the format of graphs, will be gradually updated in `README.md` with code refactoring.
